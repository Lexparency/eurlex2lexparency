               <p class="norm">Directive 85/611/EEC has largely contributed to the development and success of the European investment funds industry. However, despite the improvements introduced since its adoption, in particular in 2001, it has steadily become clear that changes need to be introduced into the UCITS legal framework in order to adapt it to the financial markets of the twenty-first century. The Commission Green Paper of 12 July 2005 on the enhancement of the EU framework for investment funds launched a public debate on the way in which Directive 85/611/EEC should be amended in order to meet those new challenges. That intense consultation process led to the largely shared conclusion that substantial amendments to that Directive are needed.</p>
